# DenseNet-Replicating
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of DenseNet architectures, replicating DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, DenseNet-201, and DenseNet-264 for study and reference purposes, with each module implemented separately to allow clear inspection of dense blocks, transition layers, and bottleneck layers without training functionality.
